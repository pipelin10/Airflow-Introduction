# Airflow Study Repository

This repository is dedicated to studying Airflow, a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It serves as a record of my progress as I follow an introductory course in Airflow.

## Introduction

Airflow is an open-source tool that allows you to define, schedule, and monitor complex workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It provides a rich set of operators and integrations with various systems, making it a powerful tool for data engineering and workflow automation.

## Course Content

Throughout the course, I will be learning the fundamentals of Airflow, including:

- Installation and setup
- Defining and scheduling DAGs
- Working with operators and tasks
- Managing dependencies and task relationships
- Monitoring and troubleshooting workflows
- Integrating with external systems

## Progress

I will be documenting my progress in this repository, including code examples, notes, and any challenges encountered along the way. Feel free to explore the different branches and folders to see my journey in learning Airflow.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, make sure you have Airflow installed on your system. You can find detailed installation instructions in the official Airflow documentation.

Once you have Airflow set up, clone this repository and follow along with the course materials. Each lesson will have its own branch, allowing you to easily navigate through the different stages of my learning journey.

## Contributions

While this repository primarily serves as a personal study resource, I welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback from the Airflow community. If you notice any errors or have ideas for improvement, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy learning!
